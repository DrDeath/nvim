# Neovim Setup

forked and adapted from https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files


_If you clone the repo into your machine and use the config by copying .config/nvim to your home folder, wait for the plugins, language servers and parsers to install with lazy.nvim, Mason and nvim-treesitter._

### Before cloning this repository to your local machine, please make a backup of your local nvim configuration:
```bash
~/.config/nvim
```
<br>
<br>

### Install this nvim config:
```bash
cd ~
mkdir -p ~/.config
git clone https://github.com/DrDeath/nvim
```
<br>
<br>

### Setup Requires

- True Color Terminal Like: [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) (Version 0.9 or Later)
- [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) - I use Meslo Nerd Font

If you're on mac, like me, you can install Neovim, Meslo Nerd Font with homebrew.

#### Nerd font:

```bash
brew install font-meslo-lg-nerd-font
```

### Neovim:

```bash
brew install neovim
```
